Avoid Virtual (Function pointer table, need to look up )
Use template to avoid branches, but avoid code explosion. Large code cause bad instruction 
inline function ? 
de-virtuallzation
LTO: APPLY STAIC,
Inline -> If hot and small -->

do not overinline, warning or long compile time 
      Do not attempt to inline fat routines, virtual routines ( ? ? ? ) I guess because it needs to look up from virtual table?
